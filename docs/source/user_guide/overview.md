# Overview

**AccelProf** is a modular, extensible, and low-overhead framework for performance analysis on heterogeneous accelerators such as **NVIDIA** and **AMD GPUs**. It offers a unified profiling interface that bridges low-level hardware event tracing with high-level deep learning (DL) framework insights, making it an effective tool for analyzing modern workloads.

AccelProf is built on top of the **PASTA** (Program AnalysiS Tool Architecture) framework, which is composed of three core, decoupled components:

- **Event Handler**: Interfaces with vendor-specific profiling APIs and DL framework callbacks to collect runtime data.
- **Processor**: Performs pre-processing of collected data‚Äîeither on the CPU or GPU‚Äîand routes it to analysis modules.
- **Tool Collection**: Hosts a variety of user-defined analysis tools that implement specific profiling features.

This clean separation of responsibilities supports easy extension, flexible integration, and compatibility across vendors and platforms.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Modular architecture** separating handler, processor, and tool logic
- üîÑ **Cross-vendor support** for NVIDIA and AMD accelerators
- üß† **Deep learning framework integration**, currently supporting PyTorch
- ‚ö° **GPU-accelerated in-situ preprocessing** (optional but highly efficient)
- üéØ **Fine-grained instrumentation** using annotation APIs (e.g., `start()`/`end()` wrappers)

## Typical Use Cases

AccelProf is suited for a wide range of performance analysis scenarios, including:

- üîç **Kernel frequency profiling** to identify performance-critical code regions
- üöÄ **UVM memory optimization** through fine-grained access pattern analysis
- üß© **Operator-level DL analysis** to capture tensor allocations, operations, and kernel execution
- üìä **Custom tool development** for research or production use

Whether you're debugging memory bottlenecks, tuning kernel launches, or analyzing large DL models, AccelProf provides a flexible platform to support your goals.
